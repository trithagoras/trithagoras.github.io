I"‡<p>This site acts as a personal portfolio as well as a place to share what Iâ€™ve learned, particularly in game dev architectures, philosophies, and anything fun I think of.</p>

<p>My name is Corey, and Iâ€™m a 20 year old from Brisbane, Australia. Iâ€™m currently in my third year of study at UQ for a bachelor of Computer Science.</p>

<p>In my free time,</p>

<p>Enjoy your stay :)</p>
